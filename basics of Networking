Core Network Components (You must know these)
🔹 Devices

Router – Connects different networks (like your home to the internet)

Switch – Connects devices inside the same network

Firewall – Security guard that allows/blocks traffic

Server – Provides services (web, email, files)

Client – Requests services (your laptop, phone)

3. IP Addresses (Digital Home Addresses)
IPv4 Example:
192.168.1.10


Public IP – Visible on the internet

Private IP – Used inside local networks

Why attackers care:

IPs reveal targets

Scanning IP ranges finds vulnerable systems

4. Ports & Services (Doors into a System)

Each service runs on a port number:

Port	Service	Risk
80	HTTP	Unencrypted
443	HTTPS	Secure
22	SSH	Brute-force attacks
21	FTP	Weak authentication
3389	RDP	Major attack target

👉 Cybersecurity rule: Close unused ports

5. Protocols (Rules of Communication)

Key ones to know:

TCP/IP – Backbone of the internet

HTTP / HTTPS – Web traffic

FTP / SFTP – File transfer

SMTP / POP3 / IMAP – Email

DNS – Converts domain names to IPs

Security angle:

Unencrypted protocols = easy to intercept

DNS can be abused for phishing & redirection

6. The OSI Model (Attackers Love This)

7 layers of communication:

Physical

Data Link

Network

Transport

Session

Presentation

Application

Why it matters:

Helps analyze attacks

Each layer has specific vulnerabilities

Example:

Layer 7 → Web attacks (SQL injection)

Layer 4 → Port scanning

7. Firewalls & Network Security
Firewall Types

Packet filtering – Basic rules

Stateful – Tracks connections

Next-Gen Firewall – Deep inspection + IDS/IPS

Firewalls:

Block malicious IPs

Control inbound/outbound traffic

Reduce attack surface

8. Common Network Attacks
Attack	Description
DDoS	Floods network with traffic
Man-in-the-Middle	Intercepts communication
Port Scanning	Finds open services
ARP Spoofing	Redirects local traffic
DNS Poisoning	Sends users to fake sites
9. Network Defense Basics

Use encryption (HTTPS, VPNs)

Segment networks (VLANs)

Monitor traffic (IDS/IPS)

Patch devices

Strong authentication

10. Tools Cybersecurity Beginners Should Know

Wireshark – Packet analysis

Nmap – Network scanning

Netstat – View connection
