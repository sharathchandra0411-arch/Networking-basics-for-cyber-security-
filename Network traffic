Types of Network Traffic
1️⃣ Incoming (Inbound)

Data coming into a network

Example: User accessing a website

⚠️ Risk: External attacks

2️⃣ Outgoing (Outbound)

Data going out of a network

Example: Sending emails, uploads

⚠️ Risk: Data exfiltration

3️⃣ Internal Traffic

Communication within a network

Example: PC ↔ Server

⚠️ Risk: Insider threats

Network Traffic Based on Protocol
🔹 TCP Traffic

Reliable

Ordered

Slower

Example: Web, email

🔹 UDP Traffic

Fast

No guarantee

Example: Streaming, DNS

Common Network Traffic Protocols
Protocol	Purpose
HTTP/HTTPS	Web
FTP	File transfer
SMTP	Email sending
DNS	Name resolution
SSH	Secure remote access
Network Traffic Flow Example
User → Router → Switch → Server


Each device:

Forwards packets

Applies rules (firewall, ACLs)

Network Traffic Monitoring
Why Monitor Traffic?

Detect attacks

Troubleshoot issues

Improve performance

Ensure compliance

Tools Used

Wireshark

tcpdump

NetFlow

IDS/IPS systems

Network Traffic in Cybersecurity
Suspicious Traffic Indicators

High packet rate

Unusual ports

Unknown IP addresses

Repeated failed connections

Large outbound transfers

Common Network Traffic Attacks
Attack	Traffic Behavior
DDoS	Traffic flood
Port Scan	Sequential port hits
MITM	Intercepted packets
Data Exfiltration	Large outbound flow
Malware C2	Periodic beaconing
Normal vs Malicious Traffic
Normal Traffic	Malicious Traffic
Predictable	Irregular
Known ports	Random ports
Known IPs	Unknown IPs
Steady flow	Spikes
Traffic Control & Protection

Firewalls

Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Traffic shaping

Rate limiting

Encryption (TLS)
