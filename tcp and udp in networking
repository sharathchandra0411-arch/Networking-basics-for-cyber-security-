TCP and UDP in Networking / Network Traffic

Both TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are transport layer (Layer 4) protocols.
They control how data moves across a network.

TCP in Network Traffic
What TCP Traffic Looks Like

Connection-based

Uses 3-way handshake

Traffic is ordered and reliable

Slower but accurate

TCP Traffic Flow
Client → SYN
Server → SYN-ACK
Client → ACK
(Data transfer)

Where TCP Is Used

Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)

Email

File transfer (FTP, SFTP)

Remote access (SSH)

TCP Traffic Characteristics

Acknowledgements (ACKs)

Retransmissions if packets are lost

Session tracking

🔐 Security angle:

Easier to monitor

Common target for SYN floods and port scans

UDP in Network Traffic
What UDP Traffic Looks Like

Connectionless

No handshake

No acknowledgements

Faster but unreliable

UDP Traffic Flow
Sender → Data
(Sender doesn’t wait)

Where UDP Is Used

Video streaming

Online gaming

VoIP (calls)

DNS

UDP Traffic Characteristics

Low latency

No retransmission

Packet loss is acceptable

⚠️ Security angle:

Harder to track

Common in DDoS attacks

Easily spoofed

TCP vs UDP (Networking & Traffic Comparison)
Feature	TCP	UDP
Connection	Yes	No
Reliability	Guaranteed	Not guaranteed
Speed	Slower	Faster
Order	Maintained	Not maintained
Handshake	Yes	No
Monitoring	Easier	Harder
Common Attacks	SYN flood	Amplification
Network Traffic Example
Loading a Website

TCP → Loads the webpage reliably

HTTPS runs over TCP

Watching a Live Stream

UDP → Sends continuous video

Missing packets don’t stop playback

TCP vs UDP in Cybersecurity Monitoring
Aspect	TCP	UDP
IDS/IPS	Effective	More challenging
Logging	Detailed	Limited
Spoofing	Harder	Easier
DDoS Risk	Medium	High
